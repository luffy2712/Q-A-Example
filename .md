## ![afjahsdkfj](./image/Discuss.png) QA001: Behaviour of connection between DIOSIM and LS and RS

**[2017-10-03][TSDV][LenLT]**

We want to confirm about **behavior of connection**
* from DIO SIM to Lane Server (after user click [Connect] button)
* from Road Side SIM to DIO SIM (after user click [] button to start automation test)
If it cannot connect 
1. Retry connect 5 times. 
2. After 5th retry connect, if it still cannot connect, show error message to notify user cannot connect to Lane Server / DIO SIM. 

**Do you have other solution?**

**[2017-10-13][SSW4][Nakayama-san]**

Please do not retry to connect on TCP/IP, only wait a result until then 30 second. 
Please refer to the source code of Log collector.

**[2017-10-13][SSW4][Nakayama-san]**

1. Retry connect 3 times.
2. After 3rd retry connect, if it still cannot connect, show error message to notify user cannot connect to Lane Server / DIO SIM.

**[2017-10-20][SSW4][Nakayama-san]**

I would like to you use UDP/IP for the interface of b/w RS Sim and DIO Sim, therefor it does not need to retry call connect() fuction on UDP/IP.

Yes, DIO sim sends DIO's data to Lane server immediately.
